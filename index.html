    <p>"There are several conditions that give rise to waterfalls. One of the most common reasons for a waterfallâ€™s existence 
        is difference in rock type. Rivers cross many lithological boundaries, and, if a river passes from a resistant rock bed 
        to a softer one, it is likely to erode the soft rock more quickly and steepen its gradient at the junction between the 
        rock types." (Sourced from Britannica)</p>
